# Crossword cheater: When working on a crossword puzzle, 
# often you will have a word where you know several of 
# the letters, but not all of them. You can write a computer 
# program to help you. For the program, the user should be 
# able to input a word with the letters they know filled in 
# and asterisks for those they donâ€™t know. The program should 
# print out a list of all words that fit that description. 
# For example, the input th***ly should return all the words 
# that could work, namely thickly and thirdly.
