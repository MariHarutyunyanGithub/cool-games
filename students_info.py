# You are given a file called students.txt. 

# A typical line in the file looks like: 
# walter melon melon@email.msmary.edu 555-3141 

# There is a name, an email address, and a phone number, 
# each separated by tabs. Write a program that reads through 
# the file line-by-line, and for each line, capitalizes the 
# first letter of the first and last name and adds the area 
# code 301 to the phone number. Your program should write this 
# to a new file called students2.txt. Here is what the first 
# line of the new file should look like:

#  Walter Melon        melon@email.msmary.edu        301-555-3141 can you generate students.txt
